McHacks Challenge - Covid19 Detection Prototype

The dataset folder contains all the data used in our model to predict ones' chance of having/contacted covid. 
We used a prototype implemented with figma to imitate what it should of looked like in a real application.
Of course, the results found in the prototype might not correspond to the actual prediction, but as mentioned before, 
this prototype is fixed and does not have any algorithm from the model implemented within.
