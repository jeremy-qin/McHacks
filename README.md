McHacks Challenge - Covid19 Detection Prototype



The dataset folder contains all the data used in our model to predict ones' chance of having/contacted covid. 
We used a prototype implemented with figma to imitate what it should of looked like in a real application.
Of course, the results found in the prototype might not correspond to the actual prediction, but as mentioned before, 
this prototype is fixed and does not have any algorithm from the model implemented within. 

To train our model, we used mindspore found on the Huawei AI Platform, an open source AI framework. If we wanted to create a real application, using mindspore allows us to create easier and faster AI applications like ours. In our case, it would be an image processing application.
